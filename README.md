# Fiete Lab - IBL ANN-RNNs Project

### Background

The goal of this project is to answer two questions:

1. How do neurally-plausible mechanistic models solve the IBL task?

2. How can a quantitative, interpretable answer be leveraged to direct 
exploration and analysis of biological circuit data?

Our approach is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to solve a simplified
version of the IBL task. Presentations are included as PDFs in `documents/`.
For a quick taste, see the 2020 April 26th's [IBL Annual Meeting Theory Working Group
presentation](documents/ibl_20200426_annual_meeting/IBL-Annual-Meeting-Theory-WG.pdf).

### Setup
After cloning the repository, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install
the project's dependencies. We used Python 3 and did not test Python 2.

### Overview
TODO

`go.sh` is a bash script for training models on a slurm server.

### Collaboration
If you're interested in collaborating on this project, we'd be delighted to hear from you. Email Rylan Schaeffer at rylanschaeffer@g.harvard.edu and cc Ila Fiete at fiete@mit.edu.
