# Fiete Lab - IBL ANN-RNNs Project

Code corresponding to the paper [Reverse-engineering
Recurrent Neural Network solutions to a hierarchical inference task for mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.142745v2).

### Setup
After cloning the repository, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install
the project's dependencies. We used Python 3 and did not test Python 2.

### Collaboration
